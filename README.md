# CoronaDataAlert
Provides a small popup window to keep the user up to date on the latest number of Covid19 cases on the national scope as well as the latest number for California alone.
Originally built to satisfy my curiosity about the current state of the pandemic without having to open up worldometer. This program essentially parses https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ and displays the values in the desktop.
